# FileOrganizer

## Overview:
A simple Python script that organizes files in a given folder into subfolders based on their file type.

This script:
- Reads file type categories from an external `categories.json` file.
- Organizes files into subfolders such as `Images`, `Documents`, `Videos`, etc.
- Supports a `simulate mode` to preview what would happen without actually moving files.
- Shows a summary of how many files were moved per category.

## ðŸ“‚ Features:
- **Custom Categories**: Easily update `categories.json` without touching the Python code.
- **Simulation Mode**: Preview changes before actually moving files.
- **Automatic Folder Creation**: Creates folders if they donâ€™t exist.
- **Summary Output**: Shows a count of files moved per category.

## Folder Structure:
1. FileOrganizer.py # Main Python script
2. categories.json # JSON file containing categories and extensions
3. README.md # This file

## How It Works:
1. The script asks for the folder path containing your files.
2. It scans only the top-level folders (ignores subfolders).
3. Based on the file extension, it moves each file into the appropriate category folder.
4. If the category folder does not exist, it is created automatically.
5. If simulation mode is enabled, files are not moved â€” only the planned moves are shown.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements:
- Python 3.x (Tested with Python 3.10)
- No extra libraries required (uses built-in Python modules: `os`, `shutil`)

### Clone or download this repository
- git clone https://github.com/ShaimaaAhmedM01/FileOrganizer.git
- cd FileOrganizer

## Run script
python FileOrganizer.py

## Example Output 
- Please type in the full path of the folder containing your files: /Users/shaimaa/Desktop/test
- Do you want to run in simulate mode? (yes/no): yes
- Simulation mode ON â€” No files will be moved.
- [SIMULATE] Would move 'photo.jpg' â†’ 'Images/'
- [SIMULATE] Would move 'report.pdf' â†’ 'Documents/'
